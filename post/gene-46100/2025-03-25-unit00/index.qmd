## install conda

```{bash}

## download miniconda from the command line

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

## or manually from https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main

## install miniconda
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

```

## create conda environment
```{bash}
conda create -n gene46100 python=3.12
conda activate gene46100

```

## do not install packages with conda
(I ran into lots ofissues with torch version incompatibility with torchvision and torchmetrics)
```{bash}
# DONT USE CONDA TO INSTALL PYTORCH at least for now
# conda install scikit-learn plotnine pytorch 

## installing torchvision and torchmetrics forced downgrading torch to 2.3.1 which is not compatible with mps

```

## install all packages within jupyter notebook with %pip
as of 2025-03-24

using %pip will make sure that the packages are accessible by the kernel you are using for the jupyter notebook
```{bash}
%pip install scikit-learn plotnine tqdm pandas 
%pip install torch
%pip install torchvision
%pip install torchmetrics
```


## install cursor or vscode to run the jupyter notebook


- install the python extension for cursor or vscode.

- select the python interpreter to be the one in the conda environment you created
