Summary by gemini:

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

1. Understand the concept of population structure in genetic data.
2. Explain how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to identify and visualize population structure.
3. Recognize how population structure can introduce bias and lead to spurious associations in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
4. Explain why correcting for population structure is important in GWAS and identify PCA (using principal components as covariates) as a primary method for doing so.
5. Interpret PCA plots in the context of genetic ancestry and population stratification (e.g., HapMap, UK Biobank examples).
6. Analyze the impact of population differences on phenotype distributions and association results (e.g., QQ plots, p-value inflation).

# The Genotype Matrix
The genotype matrix is a rich source of information. Various statistical techniques can uncover this wealth of information.

# PCA Reveals Demographic History
Principal Components (PCs) of genotype data can reflect geographic and demographic history. A famous example shows the first two PCs of European genotypes mirroring the map of Europe.

# Population Structure & GWAS Bias
Question: Could population structure bias Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results?

# Spurious Associations
Differences in population composition between cases and controls can lead to spurious associations. Example: If a specific allele is more common in population 1, and population 1 is overrepresented in cases, the allele might appear associated with the disease even if it has no true effect.

# Correcting for Population Structure
Methods:
- Genomic control (Devlin and Roeder 1999)
- Inferring latent sub-populations and analyzing within them (Pritchard et al 2000)
- Adjusting for Principal Components (PCs) as covariates (Patterson 2006, Price et al 2010) - Most common method
- Mixed effects modeling (EMMAX, Kang et al 2010)

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA (often via Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) is used for latent factor identification and dimension reduction in genotype data.

# Example - HapMap Project
The International HapMap Project gathered genotype data from diverse global populations (e.g., CEU, CHB, YRI, etc.). It aimed to create a haplotype map of the human genome. Evolved into the 1000 Genomes Project.

# Population Structure in HapMap
PCA on HapMap data reveals clear population clusters.
- PC1 often separates African ancestry populations from others reflecting the "out of Africa" demographic history
- PC2 further separates European and Asian populations

# PCA in UK Biobank
PCA applied to large datasets like the UK Biobank (500,000 individuals) also shows population structure. Requires specialized methods due to the large scale.

# GWAS in Multi-ancestry Samples
Population structure can inflate association statistics in GWAS, especially when phenotype means differ between populations.

# Example - Growth Phenotype
Analysis of a growth phenotype (cell proliferation rate) in HapMap LCLs shows significant mean differences between populations. GWAS for this phenotype without correction shows inflated p-values (deviation on QQ plot), exemplifying spurious associations driven by population structure.

# Adjusting GWAS with PCs
Adding PCs (e.g., the first 4 PCs) as covariates in the GWAS regression model helps correct for population structure. This adjustment typically leads to a more uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis. The number of PCs to include requires sensitivity analysis and careful consideration.

# Other Concepts Mentioned
- Matrix Algebra Review: Basics like addition, scalar multiplication, transposition, and matrix multiplication are fundamental
- Linear Regression: Matrix notation for linear regression (Y=Xβ+ϵ)
- Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE): Describes expected genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies under random mating; deviations can indicate population structure or other factors
- Heritability: Concepts of broad-sense vs. narrow-sense heritability, and "chip heritability" in the context of GWAS
