## Learning Objectives

### Population Structure and Association Studies
- Explain why correcting for population structure is necessary in genetic association studies
- Describe the assumptions and limitations of the Genomic Control method
- Outline the approach of inferring latent sub-populations and performing association within them
- Understand how Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to adjust for population structure

### Mixed Effects Models (MEMs)
- Explain the concept of a Mixed Effects Model in the context of genetic association studies
- Define the components of the MEM equation (Y=Xβ+u+ϵ) and the role of the genetic relatedness matrix (K)
- Describe how MEMs account for population structure, family structure, and cryptic relatedness

### LD Score Regression
- Define Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Score and explain how it's calculated
- Explain the principle behind LD Score Regression and how it distinguishes between polygenicity and confounding
- Interpret the components of the LD Score Regression equation (E[χ2∣l j]=Nh2lj/M+Na+1)
- Understand how LD Score Regression can be used to estimate SNP-based heritability
- Explain how LD Score Regression can be extended to estimate genetic correlation between traits

## Summary of Lecture Notes

### Methods for Correcting Population Structure

1. **Genomic Control**
   - Older method assuming constant effects of population stratification across the genome
   - Uses correction factor (λ) based on distribution of test statistics
   - GWAS results considered acceptable if λ values close to 1
   - Now largely superseded by LD score regression

2. **Inferring Latent Sub-populations**
   - Identifies underlying sub-populations (e.g., using STRUCTURE)
   - Performs association analysis within each sub-population
   - Followed by meta-analysis of results

3. **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**
   - Uses genetic principal components as covariates in regression models
   - Accounts for population structure through linear combinations of genetic variants

4. **Mixed Effects Models (MEMs)**
   - Incorporates random effect term to account for genetic relatedness
   - Uses genetic relatedness matrix (K) to define covariance structure
   - Effectively corrects for inflation in test statistics
   - Captures population structure, family structure, and cryptic relatedness

5. **LD Score Regression**
   - Distinguishes between inflation due to confounding and true polygenicity
   - Regresses association test statistic (Chi2) against LD score
   - Intercept estimates inflation from confounding
   - Slope relates to heritability
   - Can estimate genetic correlations between traits
   - Mathematical basis includes random effect variance structure and LD Score regression equation

### Applications
- Examples of applying LD Score regression to estimate heritability
- Genetic correlation analysis between diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, cancers, psychiatric disorders)
