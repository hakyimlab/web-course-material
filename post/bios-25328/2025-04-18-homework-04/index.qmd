## A. Complete the following assessments
- [Lecture 6 assessment quiz](https://forms.gle/2FazW6RRTqqfVgY59)   (10 points)
- [Lecture 7 assessment quiz](https://forms.gle/nDuJCpRxaP4p7eot8) (10 points)

## B. Finish the knit lab 4 (70 points)

In this section, you will complete the practical implementation of polygenic risk scoring using PRSice software as done in Lab 04. As a reminder, it involves:

1. Setting up the environment and downloading necessary data:
   - Download and install PRSice software
   - Set up the Personal Genome Project data
   - Install required R packages (tidyverse, RSQLite, glue)

2. Data exploration and preparation:
   - Explore the phenotype database
   - Analyze demographic distributions
   - Create phenotype data files for analysis

3. Running PRSice analysis:
   - Compute polygenic risk scores for height
   - Use UK Biobank height GWAS results as the base data
   - Apply various p-value thresholds for score calculation

4. Results analysis and visualization:
   - Plot observed versus predicted height values
   - Perform regression analysis to assess prediction accuracy
   - Interpret the results in the context of polygenic prediction

The lab will help you understand:
- The practical implementation of PRS calculations
- The relationship between GWAS results and phenotype prediction
- The challenges and limitations of polygenic risk scoring
- The interpretation of PRS results in real-world data

Make sure to document your code, results, and interpretations clearly in your knitted document. The grading will focus on:
- Correct implementation of the analysis pipeline
- Quality of data visualization
- Clarity of interpretation
- Proper documentation of the process
