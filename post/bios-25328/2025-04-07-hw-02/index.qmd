This assignment focuses on simulating multiple testing scenarios, understanding p-value distributions, and applying correction methods.

## Part 1: Lecture Quizzes (20 points)

- [Lecture 3 assessment quiz](https://forms.gle/KsyP7b5RYFsaAXFW6) (10 points)
- [Lecture 4 assessment quiz](https://forms.gle/gpvmRE1tJCCTfYZXA) (10 points)

## Part 2.  Multiple testing simulation (80 points)

### Goal: Simulate multiple tests to explore p-value behavior, FWER, and FDR.

### Parameters:

- Samples per sim: N = 100
- Effect size (alt): beta = 1
- Number of sims: 10000
- True null proportion: pi0 = 0.9
- Significance level: alpha = 0.05
- Models: X=rnorm(N), eps=rnorm(N), Ynull=0*X+eps, Yalt=beta*X+eps

### Tasks:

#### 2.1. Simulation Run (10 pts)
* Run 10,000 simulations. In each:
* Generate X, Ynull, Yalt.
* Fit lm(Ynull ~ X) and lm(Yalt ~ X).
* Store the p-value for X from both models.
* Create two vectors: p_null and p_alt (10,000 p-values each).

#### 2.2. P-value Distributions (10 pts)
* Plot histograms for p_null and p_alt.
* Interpret their shapes (Why uniform? Why skewed?).

#### 2.3. Mixed P-values (10 pts)
* Create a logical vector is_null (length 10k, pi0 proportion TRUE). Shuffle it.
* Create p_mixed by selecting from p_null if is_null is TRUE, else from p_alt.
* Plot a histogram and a QQ plot (p_mixed vs. uniform quantiles, add y=x line).
* Interpret the QQ plot (adherence to and deviation from the line).

#### 2.4. Confusion Matrix & Reality Check (15 pts)
* Using p_mixed, is_null, and alpha = 0.05, calculate the counts for TN, FP, FN, TP.
* In real data analysis, can this table be perfectly known? Explain why/why not.

#### 2.5. Bonferroni Correction (15 pts)
* Calculate the Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for p_mixed.
* How many tests are significant using this threshold?
* Recalculate TN, FP, FN, TP counts with the Bonferroni threshold.
* Discuss the FP vs. TP trade-off compared to the uncorrected alpha = 0.05.

#### 2.6. FDR Control with qvalue (20 pts)
* Use qvalue::qvalue() on p_mixed.
* Report the estimated pi0 from the result. How does it compare to the true pi0 used?
* How many tests are significant at an FDR threshold of 0.1 (q-value â‰¤ 0.1)?
* Compare this number of significant tests to the numbers from the uncorrected and Bonferroni approaches.
* Briefly state the conceptual difference between controlling FWER and FDR.

### Extra Credit

#### EC.1. More realistic genotype predictor (+10 points)
* Rerun key parts of the simulation (e.g., 2.1-2.6) using X simulated as genotypes {0, 1, 2} assuming MAF=0.3 and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. You will want to use `rbinom(nsam,2,0.3)` to simulate genotypes. Report key findings/differences.

#### EC.2. Binary trait (+10 points)
* Rerun key parts using a simulated binary trait Y (dependent on X for alternatives) and logistic regression (glm(Y ~ X, family=binomial)) to obtain p-values. Report key findings/differences.
